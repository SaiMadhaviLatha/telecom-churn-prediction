Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This machine learning project focuses on predicting customer churn using a real-world telecom dataset. The goal is to help businesses identify customers likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a common challenge in the telecom industry. Using customer demographics, service usage, and billing data, this project builds a predictive model to classify whether a customer will churn.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights:
- 📉 **Low tenure** customers churn more frequently.
- 💰 **High monthly charges** increase churn risk.
- 📊 **Total charges** are low for churned customers (short tenure).
- 🔗 **Strong correlation** (0.83) between tenure and total charges.

## 🧠 Model Summary

- Algorithm: **Logistic Regression**
- Accuracy: **73%**
- Churn Recall: **0.75** (model identifies 75% of churners)
- Churn Precision: **0.49** (needs improvement for business use)
